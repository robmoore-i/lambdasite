            The repository for this tool is at:
            <a href="https://github.com/robmoore-i/lambdasite">https://github.com/robmoore-i/lambdasite</a>

            It is a few scripts and supporting resources which make it easy for me to create very cheaply
            hosted documents on the internet using AWS Lambda. This is essentially a very shitty version of
            <a href="https://claudiajs.com/">Claudia.js</a> which was shown to me by
            <a href="https://gojko.net/">Gojko Adzic</a> at <a href="https://citconf.com/">CITCON</a> in May 2018.
            It was interesting to learn about all the API gateway stuff that goes into getting a live lambda.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            For example, this web page was created like this:
            <pre>
python3 create-page.py lambdasite
cd lambdasite-webpage
* edit src/document.html *
./update-lambda.sh
            </pre>
            I am using this collection of webpages to cheaply upload my thoughts to the internet,
            as though enough people didn't do that already.
