    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        I wanted to discuss this topic because while I don't encounter it frequently, I think the effect
        it has on other people and psychological safety is really unacceptable. I am not ashamed to admit
        that I am very afflicted by this nonsense sadly - of course you might be fortunate enough to think
        "Oh I didn't think Rob was like that", but that would probably be because I'm always getting better!
        I will inevitably miss some things, but that's part and parcel with writing your thoughts down, so I
        won't feel bad.

    <h3 style="color: orange; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%">What effect does macho nonsense have on men?</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        Many men have learned that there are some properties that must be true about them if they are to be accepted
        as valuable people. In bad cases, they learn that these properties form the core of their worth as a person.
        The catch is that these things are not true in any consistent interpretation of reality. This requirement of
        cognitive dissonance causes men to behave in really strange ways! When their reality (the one they construct
        to protect their ego) is threatened they become defensive. This fear of being exposed as a normal human and
        not an action-man like James Bond is, as far as I can think of, the cause of the variety of interesting but
        unfortunate behaviours:
        <ul style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
            <li>Defensive upon indications of having been incorrect about something at some point</li>
            <li>A desire to express that they are really strong and smart</li>
            <li>Pride in unhealthy and unnecessary exertion</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: orange; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%">And what effect does that have on other people
        and psychological safety? : Defensiveness</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        Not a good one! When people feel that they are on eggshells trying to navigate the male ego they are unlikely
        to produce the kind of fast, quality feedback that a team needs in order to thrive! If problems occur and are
        not addressed because the solution is to tell Robinho that he was wrong and needs to just stop, but we think
        that'll cause him to sulk and be worse than useless, then maybe we'll just leave it. That's a bad outcome,
        and it happened because Robinho's macho nonsense caused the team to feel unsafe.

    <h3 style="color: orange; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%">And what effect does that have on other people
        and psychological safety? : Peacocking</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        Insecure men dominating conversations is a phenomenon that has the potential to cause other team mates to
        feel unheard and feel that maybe what they have to say isn't important. This is obviously very bad for safety.
        Additionally, if the man in question is of seniority and is for whatever reason looked up to, the quality of
        excessively occupying space in a discussion will be transferred to the team as something that senior people
        are meant to do, which extends this problem. The best people I know speak less and listen more, and when they
        do speak, you don't get the feeling that it's about them.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: orange; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%">And what effect does that have on other people
        and psychological safety? : Unsustainable pace</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        I have been and continue to be proud of sleeping in the library and washing at the gym during my final
        exam week of university. This is foolish behaviour. A pace like this is never sustainable and will damage
        performance over the kinds of time-spans required to deliver valuable software. Additionally, such
        behaviour may put pressure on team mates to demonstrate similar levels of presenteeism, causing further
        burnout and damage to the team's performance, not to mention their mental health! This kind of macho
        nonsense should undoubtedly be discouraged.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: orange; margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%">Summary</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        Macho nonsense describes a set of nonsense beliefs held by men which cause them to behave oddly, in ways
        that themselves may be described as macho nonsense. These behaviours undermine psychological safety and in
        turn the mental health and productivity of the team. Macho nonsense should be discouraged and men should be
        coached and mentored to help them not behave in this way. Personally I favour a more extreme position: Stop
        hiring men, or at least screen them in the interview. I believe Thoughtworks already incorporates a
        combination of these strategies - a 50:50 gender balanced engineering workforce and a "personality interview".
        I took that interview about a year and a half ago and failed it - I hope I would pass now.
