        I came into work this morning and fairly soon after arriving I was nasty to my friend Susan. Moments after the
        interaction I thought to myself, "What the fuck was that?". It was fairly harmless thankfully, but still bad. The day's
        clearest abnormality was that I had not slept the night before. I had also learnt from my friend Peter Brown the night
        before at XTC that poor sleep seriously affects mental performance. I learnt that yesterday. I already knew that the only
        reason I'm not an arrogant prick <em>all</em> the time is because I can stop myself. This combined knowledge helped me to see that
        those who are dependent on fast brain performance for their desired personality will be unable to socially interact in
        the way that want when their thinking is badly retarded, for example when they are sleep deprived. This is an
        unacceptable outcome and me and my brain will be having a chat about it's SLAs later.

        Studies about reaction times should matter to you if you use inhibitions to manage underlying personality defects
    </h3>

        It was today that I realised that the speed of your brain is actually really important. It's not about how fast you can
        press a button in in a lab for another dumb reaction times study, it's about <em>if</em> your brain will have time to
        stop you doing or saying something stupid. I've only read a few chapters of "Thinking, fast and slow", but I imagine
        that if I had perservered and read a bit more I would have learned this already.

        A better idea: Be a good person so you don't need inhibitions
    </h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        If you didn't lean on your brain's postprocessing power then even if you were sleep deprived, you could go into work and
        hang out with your friends without being a twat! What a world that would be! Using inhibitions as personality crutches
        works fine most of the time, but here's a news flash! "Most of the time" is not good enough.

    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        Maybe I'm just a bad person and that's just the way things are. This is the fixed mindset. I present it as bad in this
        context, because it doesn't help, it just makes you look like a whiny prick who feels sorry for themselves, literally
        about being a bad person. Pathetic! To the end of not giving this impression I try and encourage others to try to remain
        positive - one day I'll be a good person and if you aren't already, then you will be able to do it too :)

    <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%; line-height: 2">
        I wrote all this bullshit and I still have an attitude problem today and I probably still will tomorrow. I disect it to
        death and it continues to seem as though I am a slave to my ego. Further irony is that I proposed the topic for last
        night's XTC - "Deconstructing macho bullshit in software."

        Did you seriously just do all that mental gymnastics just to absolve yourself of being a dickhead?
